  """Adds a boolean coordinate named 'mask' to each variable with False indicating NaN values.

  When applied to targets, these masks should propagate to statistics and will
  be used by Aggregator (when masked=True) to skip evaluation units
  corresponding to NaN targets during its aggregation of statistics.

  We strongly recommend to do it this way rather than using skipna=True in the
  aggregator, because we want unexpected NaNs in the statistics (e.g. arising
  unexpected NaNs in the predictions or targets, or buggy metrics code) to
  propagate loudly and cause an error, rather than silently causing some of the
  evaluation units to be skipped, delivering biased evaluation results which
  hide a bug.

  Args:
    data: Data to add the mask to.
    variable_subset: If provided, only add masks to the variables in this list.
      Masks use memory and some compute, so we encourage limiting them to
      variables which are actually expected to contain masking information in
      the form of NaNs.

  Returns:
    The data with any masks added.
